Assignment 2

Every thing done as asked in the assignment.

To Run:
1.Place the AddressBook folder in the Tomcat/webapps folder.
2.Place user's folders(namely ash,avijit,third) in the Tomcat/bin  folder, which worked for my account in osl.In windows we hav to place them in Tomcat/  folder.
   In the submission we have placed these folders in the AddressBook folder.
3.Start the tomcat server. and in the browser write the link "http://localhost:8080/AddressBook/Welcome.jsp"


Limitations: 
1.We have stored the password of the user in it's own folder in the text file namely "$password$.txt".
   So no user can have Lastname as "$password$"
2.Since we hav stored the addresses of the users with their lastname, so 2 users can have same Lastname.

Test Cases:
Username    Password
ash	    ash12!
avijit	    avi12!
third	    third12!
